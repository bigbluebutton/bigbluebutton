      BigBlueButton is a global platform designed for both online meetings and
      virtual classes

      For meetings, it fosters rich engagement through real-time sharing of
      audio, video, slides, chat, and screen. Built-in collaboration features
      include a multi-user digital whiteboard for live annotations and drawing,

      with built-in tools for active learning and live analytics to ensure
      every student learns.
