# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support BigBlueButton through the community forums and through security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.6.x (or earlier)  | :x:    |
| 2.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.1.x   | :x: |

We have released 3.0 to the community and are going to support 3.0 for the coming months, while 2.7 will receive BigBlueButton patches until April 2025 when Ubuntu 20.04 will see its community support end.  Also, BigBlueButton 2.6 is now end of life.

As such, we recommend that all administrators deploy 3.0 going forward.  You'll find [many improvements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features) in this newer version.
