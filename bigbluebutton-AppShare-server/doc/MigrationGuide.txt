Preface
==========================
This document describes API differences between the Macromedia Flash
Communication Server / Adobe Flash Media Server and Red5.  It aims at helping
migrate existing applications to Red5.

If you don't have an application in Red5 yet, please read the tutorial about
`howto create new applications`__ first.


Application callbacks
==========================
When implementing serverside applications, one of the most important
functionalities is to get notified about clients that connect or disconnect
and to be informed about the creation of new instances of the application.


Interface IScopeHandler
--------------------------
Red5 specifies these actions in the interface IScopeHandler_.  See the API
documentation for further details.


Class ApplicationAdapter
--------------------------
As some methods may be called multiple times for one request (e.g. `connect`
will be called once for every scope in the tree the client connects to),
the class ApplicationAdapter_ defines additional methods.

This class usually is used as base class for new applications.

Here is a short overview of methods of the FCS / FMS `application` class and
their corresponding methods of ApplicationAdapter_ in Red5:

=============== ===============
FCS / FMS       Red5
=============== ===============
onAppStart      appStart
                roomStart
onAppStop       appStop
                roomStop
onConnect       appConnect
                roomConnect
                appJoin
                roomJoin
onDisconnect    appDisconnect
                roomDisconnect
                appLeave
                roomLeave
=============== ===============

The `app*` methods are called for the main application, the `room*` methods
are called for rooms (i.e. instances) of the application.

You can also also use the ApplicationAdapter_ to check for streams, shared
objects, or subscribe them.  See the API documentation for further details.


Execution order of connection methods
`````````````````````````````````````
Assuming you connect to `rtmp://server/app/room1/room2`

At first, the connection is established, so the user "connects" to all scopes
that are traversed up to `room2`:

1. `app`     (-> appConnect)
2. `room1`   (-> roomConnect)
3. `room2`   (-> roomConnect)

After the connection is established, the client object is retrieved and if
it's the first connection by this client to the scope, he "joins" the scopes:

1. `app`     (-> appJoin)
2. `room1`   (-> roomJoin)
3. `room2`   (-> roomJoin)

If the same client establishes a second connection to the same scope, only
the `connect` methods will be called.  If you conect to partially the same
scopes, only a few `join` methods might be called, e.g.
`rtmp://server/app/room1/room3` will trigger

1. `appConnect("app")`
2. `joinConnect("room1")`
3. `joinConnect("room3")`
4. `roomJoin("room3")`

The `appStart` method currently is only called once during startup of Red5
as it currently can't unload/load applications like FCS/FMS does.
The `roomStart` methods are called when the first client connects to a room. 


Accepting / rejecting clients
-----------------------------
FCS / FMS provide the methods `acceptConnection` and `rejectConnection` to
accept and reject new clients.  To allow clients to connect, no special
action is required by Red5 applications, the `*Connect` methods just need
to return `true` in this case.

If a client should not be allowed to connect, the method `rejectClient`
can be called which is implemented by the ApplicationAdapter_ class. Any
parameter passed to `rejectClient` is available as the `application`
property of the status object that is returned to the caller.


Current connection and client
=============================
Red5 supports two different ways to access the current connection from an
invoked method.  The connection can  be used to get the active client and
the scope he is connected to.  The first possibility uses the "magic" Red5_
object::

  import org.red5.server.api.IClient;
  import org.red5.server.api.IConnection;
  import org.red5.server.api.IScope;
  import org.red5.server.api.Red5;

  public void whoami() {
      IConnection conn = Red5.getConnectionLocal();
      IClient client = conn.getClient();
      IScope scope = conn.getScope();
      // ...
  }

The second possiblity requires the method to be defined with an argument of
type IConnection_ as implicit first parameter which is automatically added
by Red5 when a client calls the method::

  import org.red5.server.api.IClient;
  import org.red5.server.api.IConnection;
  import org.red5.server.api.IScope;

  public void whoami(IConnection conn) {
      IClient client = conn.getClient();
      IScope scope = conn.getScope();
      // ...
  }


Additional handlers
==========================
For many applications, existing classes containing application logic that
is not related to Red5 are required to be reused.  In order to make them
available for clients connecting through RTMP, these classes need to be
registered as handlers in Red5.

There are currently two ways to register these handlers:
 1. By adding them to the configuration files.
 2. By registering them manually from the application code.

The handlers can be executed by clients with code similar to this::

    nc = new NetConnection();
    nc.connect("rtmp://localhost/myapp");
    nc.call("handler.method", nc, "Hello world!");

If a handler is requested, Red5 always looks it up in the custom scope
handlers before checking the handlers that have been set up in the context
through the configuration file.


Handlers in configuration files
-------------------------------
This method is best suited for handlers that are common to all scopes the
application runs in and that don't need to change during the lifetime of
an application.

To register the class `com.fancycode.red5.HandlerSample` as handler `sample`,
the following bean needs to be added to `WEB-INF/red5-web.xml`::

    <bean id="sample.service" 
          class="com.fancycode.red5.HandlerSample" 
          singleton="true" />

Note that the id of the bean is constructed as the name of the handler
(here `sample`) and the keyword `service`.


Handlers from application code
------------------------------
All applications that use handlers which are different for the various
scopes or want to change handlers, need a way to register them from the
serverside code.  These handlers always override the handlers configured in
`red5-web.xml`.  The methods required for registration are described in the
interface IServiceHandlerProvider_ which is implemented by
ApplicationAdapter_.

The same class as above can be registered using this code::

    public boolean appStart(IScope app) {
        if (!super.appStart(scope))
            return false;
        
        Object handler = new com.fancycode.red5.HandlerSample();
        app.registerServiceHandler("sample", handler);
        return true;
    }

Note that in this example, only the application scope has the `sample`
handler but not the subscopes!  If the handler should be available in the
rooms as well, it must be registered in `roomStart` for the room scopes.


Calls to client methods
==========================
To call methods from your Red5 application on the client, you will first need
a reference to the current connection object::

    import org.red5.server.api.IConnection;
    import org.red5.server.api.Red5;
    import org.red5.server.api.service.IServiceCapableConnection;
    ...
    IConnection conn = Red5.getConnectionLocal();

If the connection implements the IServiceCapableConnection_ interface, it
supports calling methods on the other end::

    if (conn instanceof IServiceCapableConnection) {
        IServiceCapableConnection sc = (IServiceCapableConnection) conn;
        sc.invoke("the_method", new Object[]{"One", 1});
    }


If you need the result of the method call, you must provide a class that
implements the IPendingServiceCallback_ interface::

    import org.red5.server.api.service.IPendingService;
    import org.red5.server.api.service.IPendingServiceCallback;
    
    class MyCallback implements IPendingServiceCallback {
    
        public void resultReceived(IPendingServiceCall call) { 
            // Do something with "call.getResult()"
        }
    }

The method call looks now like this::

    if (conn instanceof IServiceCapableConnection) {
        IServiceCapableConnection sc = (IServiceCapableConnection) conn;
        sc.invoke("the_method", new Object[]{"One", 1}, new MyCallback());
    }

Of course you can implement this interface in your application and pass a
reference to the application instance.


SharedObjects
==========================
The methods to access shared objects from an application are specified in the
interface ISharedObjectService_.

When dealing with shared objects in serverside scripts, special care must be
taken about the scope they are created in.

To create a new shared object when a room is created, you can override the
method `roomStart` in your application::

  import org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter;
  import org.red5.server.api.IScope;
  import org.red5.server.api.so.ISharedObject;
  
  public class SampleApplication extends ApplicationAdapter {
  
    public boolean roomStart(IScope room) {
        if (!super.roomStart(room))
            return false;
        
        createSharedObject(room, "sampleSO", true);
        ISharedObject so = getSharedObject(room, "sampleSO");
      
        // Now you could do something with the shared object...
      
        return true;		
    }
    
  }

Now everytime a first user connects to a room of a application, e.g. through
`rtmp://server/application/room1`, a shared object `sampleSO` is created by
the server.

If a shared object should be created for connections to the main application,
e.g. `rtmp://server/application`, the same must be done in the method
`appStart`.

For further informations about the possible methods a shared object provides
please refer to the api documentation of the interface ISharedObject_.


Serverside change listeners
---------------------------
To get notified about changes of the shared object similar to `onSync` in
FCS / FMS, a listener must implement the interface ISharedObjectListener_::

  import org.red5.server.api.so.ISharedObject;
  import org.red5.server.api.so.ISharedObjectListener;

  public class SampleSharedObjectListener
         implements ISharedObjectListener {

    public void onSharedObjectUpdate(ISharedObject so,
                                     String key, Object value) {
        // The attribute <key> of the shared object <so>
        // was changed to <value>.
    }

    public void onSharedObjectDelete(ISharedObject so, String key) {
        // The attribute <key> of the shared object <so> was deleted.
    }

    public void onSharedObjectSend(ISharedObject so,
                                   String method, List params) {
        // The handler <method> of the shared object <so> was called
        // with the parameters <params>.
    }
    
    // Other methods as described in the interface...
  }


Additionally, the listener must get registered at the shared object::

  ISharedObject so = getSharedObject(scope, "sampleSO");
  so.addSharedObjectListener(new SampleSharedObjectListener())


Changing from application code
------------------------------
A shared object can be changed by the server as well::

  ISharedObject so = getSharedObject(scope, "sampleSO");
  so.setAttribute("fullname", "Sample user");

Here all subscribed clients as well as the registered handlers are notified
about the new / changed attribute.


If multiple actions on a shared object should be combined in one update
event to the subscribed clients, the methods `beginUpdate` and `endUpdate`
must be used::

  ISharedObject so = getSharedObject(scope, "sampleSO");
  so.beginUpdate();
  so.setAttribute("One", "1");
  so.setAttribute("Two", "2");
  so.removeAttribute("Three");
  so.endUpdate();

The serverside listeners will receive their update notifications through
separate method calls as without the `beginUpdate` and `endUpdate`.


SharedObject event handlers
----------------------------
Calls to shared object handlers through `remote_so.send(<handler>, <args>)`
from a Flash client or the corresponding serverside call can be mapped to
methods in Red5.  Therefore a handler must get registered through a method
of the ISharedObjectHandlerProvider_ interface similar to the application
handlers::

  package com.fancycode.red5;

  class MySharedObjectHandler {
  
      public void myMethod(String arg1) {
          // Now do something
      }
      
  }

  ...
  ISharedObject so = getSharedObject(scope, "sampleSO");
  so.registerServiceHandler(new MySharedObjectHandler());

Handlers with a given name can be registered as well::

  ISharedObject so = getSharedObject(scope, "sampleSO");
  so.registerServiceHandler("one.two", new MySharedObjectHandler());

Here, the method could be called through `one.two.myMethod`.

Another way to define event handlers for SharedObjects is to add them to the
`red5-web.xml` similar to the file-based application handlers.  The beans
must have a name of `<SharedObjectName>.<DottedServiceName>.soservice`, so
the above example could also be defined with::

    <bean id="sampleSO.one.two.soservice" 
          class="com.fancycode.red5.MySharedObjectHandler" 
          singleton="true" />


Persistence
==========================
Persistence is used so properties of objects can be used even after the server
has been restarted.  In FCS / FMS usually local shared objects on the
serverside are used for this.

Red5 allows arbitrary objects to be persistent, all they need to do is
implement the interface IPersistable_.  Basically these objects have a `type`,
a `path`, a `name` (all strings) and know how to serialize and deserialize
themselves.

Here is a sample of serialization and deserialization::

  import java.io.IOException;
  import org.red5.io.object.Input;
  import org.red5.io.object.Output;
  import org.red5.server.api.persistence.IPersistable;
  
  class MyPersistentObject implements IPersistable {

    // Attribute that will be made persistent
    private String data = "My persistent value";

    void serialize(Output output) throws IOException {
        // Save the objects's data.
        output.writeString(data);
    }
	
    void deserialize(Input input) throws IOException {
        // Load the object's data.
        data = input.readString();
    }
    
    // Other methods as described in the interface...
  }


To save or load this object, the following code can be used::

  import org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter;
  import org.red5.server.api.IScope;
  import org.red5.server.api.Red5;
  import org.red5.server.api.persistence.IPersistenceStore;
  
  class MyApplication extends ApplicationAdapter {
  
    private void saveObject(MyPersistentObject object) {
        // Get current scope.
        IScope scope = Red5.getConnectionLocal().getScope();
        // Save object in current scope.
        scope.getStore().save(object);
    }
  
    private void loadObject(MyPersistentObject object) {
        // Get current scope.
        IScope scope = Red5.getConnectionLocal().getScope();
        // Load object from current scope.
        scope.getStore().load(object);
    }
    
  }


If no custom objects are required for an application, but data must be stored
for future reuse, it can be added to the IScope_ through the interface
IAttributeStore_.  In scopes, all attributes that don't start with
`IPersistable.TRANSIENT_PREFIX` are persistent.

The backend that is used to store objects is configurable.  By default
persistence in memory and in the filesystem is available.

When using filesystem persistence for every object a file is created in
"webapps/<app>/persistence/<type>/<path>/<name>.red5", e.g. for a shared
object "theSO" in the connection to "rtmp://server/myApp/room1" a file at
"webapps/myApp/persistence/SharedObject/room1/theSO.red5" would be created.


Periodic events
==========================
Applications that need to perform tasks regularly can use the `setInterval`
in FCS / FMS to schedule methods for periodic execution.

Red5 provides a scheduling service (ISchedulingService_) that is implemented
by ApplicationAdapter_ like most other services.  The service can register
an object (which needs to implement the IScheduledJob_ interface) whose
`execute` method is called in a given interval.

To register an object, code like this can be used::

  import org.red5.server.api.IScope;
  import org.red5.server.api.IScheduledJob;
  import org.red5.server.api.ISchedulingService;
  import org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter;
  
  class MyJob implements IScheduledJob {
  
    public void execute(ISchedulingService service) {
        // Do something
    }
  }

  public class SampleApplication extends ApplicationAdapter {
  
    public boolean roomStart(IScope room) {
        if (!super.roomStart(room))
            return false;
        
        // Schedule invokation of job every 10 seconds.
        String id = addScheduledJob(10000, new MyJob());
        room.setAttribute("MyJobId", id);
        return true;		
    }
  }
  
The id that is returned by `addScheduledJob` can be used later to stop
execution of the registered job::

    public void roomStop(IScope room) {
        String id = (String) room.getAttribute("MyJobId");
        removeScheduledJob(id);
        super.roomStop(room);
    }


Remoting
==========================
Remoting can be used by non-rtmp clients to invoke methods in Red5.  Another
possibility is to call methods from Red5 to other servers that provide a
remoting service.


Remoting server
--------------------------
Services that should be available for clients need to be registered the same
way as additional application handlers are registered.  See above for details.

To enable remoting support for an application, the following section must be
added to the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file::

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>gateway</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
        org.red5.server.net.servlet.AMFGatewayServlet
    </servlet-class>
  </servlet>
    
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>gateway</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/gateway/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>

The path specified in the `<url-pattern>` tag (here `gateway`) can be used
by the remoting client as connection url.  If this example would have been
specified for an application `myApp`, the URL would be::

  http://localhost:5080/myApp/gateway

Methods invoked through this connection will be executed in the context of
the application scope.  If the methods should be executed in subscopes, the
path to the subscopes must be added to the URL like::

  http://localhost:5080/myApp/gateway/room1/room2


Remoting client
--------------------------
The class RemotingClient_ defines all methods that are required to call
methods through the remoting protocol.

The following code serves as example about how to use the remoting client::

  import org.red5.server.net.remoting.RemotingClient;
  
  String url = "http://server/path/to/service";
  RemotingClient client = new RemotingClient(url);
  Object[] args = new Object[]{"Hello world!"};
  Object result = client.invokeMethod("service.remotingMethod", args);
  // Now do something with the result

By default, a timeout of 30 seconds will be used per call, this can be
changed by passing a second parameter to the constructor defining the maximum
timeout in milliseconds.

The remoting headers `AppendToGatewayUrl`, `ReplaceGatewayUrl` and
`RequestPersistentHeader` are handled automatically by the Red5 remoting
client.

Some methods may take a rather long time on the called server to complete, so
it's better to perform the call asynchronously to avoid blocking a thread in
Red5.  Therefore an object that implements the interface IRemotingCallback_
must be passed as additional parameter::

  import org.red5.server.net.remoting.RemotingClient;
  import org.red5.server.net.remoting.IRemotingCallback;
  
  public class CallbackHandler implements IRemotingCallback {
  
    void errorReceived(RemotingClient client, String method,
                       Object[] params, Throwable error) {
        // An error occurred while performing the remoting call.
    }
    
    void resultReceived(RemotingClient client, String method,
                        Object[] params, Object result) {
        // The result was received from the server.
    }
  }
  
  String url = "http://server/path/to/service";
  RemotingClient client = new RemotingClient(url);
  Object[] args = new Object[]{"Hello world!"};
  IRemotingCallback callback = new CallbackHandler();
  client.invokeMethod("service.remotingMethod", args, callback);
