Preface
==========================
This document describes how new applications can be created in Red5.
It applies to the new API introduced by Red5 0.4.


The application directory
==========================
Red5 stores all application definitions as folders inside the "webapps"
directory beneath the root of Red5.  So the first thing you will have to
do in order to create a new application, is to create a new subfolder
in "webapps".  By convention this folder should get the same name the
application will be reached later.

Inside your new application, you will need a folder "WEB-INF" containing
configuration files about the classes to use.  You can use the templates
provided by Red5 in the folder "doc/templates/myapp".

During the start of Red5, all folders inside "webapps" are searched for
a directory "WEB-INF" containing the configuration files.


Configuration
==========================
The main configuration file that is loaded is "web.xml".  It contains the
following parameters:

globalScope
--------------------------
The name of the global scope, this should be left at the default::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>globalScope</param-name>
        <param-value>default</param-value>
    </context-param>


contextConfigLocation
--------------------------
Specifies the name(s) of handler configuration files for this application.
The handler configuration files reference the classes that are used to notify
the application about joining / leaving clients and that provide the methods
a client can call.

Additionally, the handler configuration files specify the scope hierarchy for
these classes.

The path name given here can contain wildcards to load multiple files::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/red5-*.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>


locatorFactorySelector
--------------------------
References the configuration file of the root application context which
usually is "red5.xml"::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>locatorFactorySelector</param-name>
        <param-value>red5.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>


parentContextKey
--------------------------
Name of the parent context, this usually is "default.context"::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>parentContextKey</param-name>
        <param-value>default.context</param-value>
    </context-param>

log4jConfigLocation
--------------------------
Path to the configuration file for the logging subsystem::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>log4jConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/log4j.properties</param-value>
    </context-param>


webAppRootKey
--------------------------
Unique name for this application, should be the public name::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>webAppRootKey</param-name>
        <param-value>/myapp</param-value>
    </context-param>


Handler configuration
==========================
Every handler configuration file must contain at least three beans:

Context
--------------------------
The context bean has the reserved name `web.context` and is used to map paths
to scopes, lookup services and handlers.  The default class for this is
`org.red5.server.Context`.

By default this bean is specified as::

    <bean id="web.context" class="org.red5.server.Context" 
          autowire="byType" />

Every application can only have one context.  However this context can be
shared across multiple scopes.


Scopes
--------------------------
Every application needs at least one scope that links the handler to the
context and the server.  The scopes can be used to build a tree where clients
can connect to every node and share objects inside this scope (like shared
objects or live streams).  You can see the scopes as rooms or instances.

The default scope usually has the name `web.scope`, but the name can be chosen
arbitrarily.

The bean has the following properties:

  `server`
    This references the global server `red5.server`.
  `parent`
    References the parent for this scope and usually is `global.scope`.
  `context`
    The server context for this scope, use the `web.context` from above.
  `handler`
    The handler for this scope (see below).
  `contextPath`
    The path to use when connecting to this scope.
  `virtualHosts`
    A comma separated list of hostnames or ip addresses this scope runs at.


A sample definition looks like this::

    <bean id="web.scope" class="org.red5.server.WebScope"
          init-method="register">
        <property name="server" ref="red5.server" />
        <property name="parent" ref="global.scope" />
        <property name="context" ref="web.context" />
        <property name="handler" ref="web.handler" />
        <property name="contextPath" value="/myapp" />
        <property name="virtualHosts" value="localhost, 127.0.0.1" />
    </bean>


You can move the values for `contextPath` and `virtualHosts` to a separate
properties file and use parameters.  In that case you need another bean::

    <bean id="placeholderConfig"
          class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
        <property name="location" value="/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties" />
    </bean>

Assuming a `red5-web.properties` containing the following data::

    webapp.contextPath=/myapp
    webapp.virtualHosts=localhost, 127.0.0.1

the properties of the scope can now be changed to::

    <property name="contextPath" value="${webapp.contextPath}" />
    <property name="virtualHosts" value="${webapp.virtualHosts}" />

The `contextPath` specified in the configuration can be seen as "root" path
of the scope.  You can add additional elements after the configured path when
connecting to dynamically create extra scopes.

These extra scopes all use the same handler but have their own properties,
shared objects and live streams.


Handlers
--------------------------
Every context needs a handler that implements the methods called when a client
connects to the scope, leaves it and that contains additional methods that can
be called by the client.  The interface these handlers need to implement is
specified by `org.red5.server.api.IScopeHandler`, however you can implement
other interfaces if you want to control access to shared objects or streams.

A sample implementation that can be used as base class can be found at
`org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter`.  Please refer to the javadoc
documentation for further details.

The bean for a scope handler is configured by::

    <bean id="web.handler" 
          class="the.path.to.my.Application" 
          singleton="true" />

The `id` attribute is referenced by the scope definition above.

If you don't need any special server-side logic, you can use the default
application handler provided by Red5::

    <bean id="web.handler" 
          class="org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter" 
          singleton="true" />


Sample handler
==========================

A sample handler can be implemented in a few lines of code::

    package the.path.to.my;
    
    import org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter;
    
    public class Application extends ApplicationAdapter {
        
        public Double add(Double a, Double b){
            return a + b;
        }
    
    }

Assuming the sample configuration above, you can call this method using the
following ActionScript snippet::

    nc = new NetConnection();
    nc.connect("rtmp://localhost/myapp");
    nc.onResult = function(obj) {
        trace("The result is " + obj);
    }
    nc.call("add", nc, 1, 2);

This should give you the output::

    The result is 3
