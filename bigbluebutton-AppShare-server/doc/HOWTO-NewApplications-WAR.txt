Preface
==========================
This document describes how applications can be configured in Red5 when using the WAR
implementation. In this version of Red5 the J2EE container is not contained within Red5
and therefore is configured differently. This document assumes that the application WAR has
already been expanded.


The application directory
==========================
An application war is normally expanded into a directory based upon the name of the war file, eg. red5.war
expands into tomcat/webapps/red5 on a Tomcat server. In a standard Red5 installation, all the applications 
are stored within their own directory under the webapps directory; the difference here is that they are all
located in the same directory.


Configuration
==========================
The WAR version stores all application definitions as Spring configuration files suffixed with the
string "-context.xml"; If your application was called ofla then its configuration file would be
named "ofla-context.xml". The context files are loaded automatically upon server startup.

The main configuration file that is loaded is "web.xml".  It contains the following parameters:

globalScope
--------------------------
The name of the global scope, this should be left at the default::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>globalScope</param-name>
        <param-value>default</param-value>
    </context-param>


contextConfigLocation
--------------------------
Specifies the name(s) of handler configuration files for this application.
The handler configuration files reference the classes that are used to notify
the application about joining / leaving clients and that provide the methods
a client can call.

Additionally, the handler configuration files specify the scope hierarchy for
these classes.

The path name given here can contain wildcards to load multiple files::

	<context-param>
		<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml, /WEB-INF/red5-common.xml, /WEB-INF/red5-core.xml, /WEB-INF/*-context.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>


listener (start-up / shutdown)
--------------------------
References the context listener servlet of the application, this technically takes the place of
the Standalone.class in a standard Red5 server

	<listener>
		<!-- Impersonates a org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener -->
		<listener-class>org.red5.server.MainServlet</listener-class>
	</listener>


parentContextKey
--------------------------
Name of the parent context, this usually is "default.context"::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>parentContextKey</param-name>
        <param-value>default.context</param-value>
    </context-param>

log4jConfigLocation
--------------------------
Path to the configuration file for the logging subsystem::

    <context-param>
        <param-name>log4jConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/log4j.properties</param-value>
    </context-param>


Handler configuration
==========================
Every handler configuration file must contain at least three beans:

Context
--------------------------
The default context bean has the reserved name 'web.context' and is used to map paths to scopes,
lookup services and handlers.  The default class for this is 'org.red5.server.Context'.

By default this bean is specified as::

    <bean id="web.context" class="org.red5.server.Context" autowire="byType" />

Every application can only have one context and they should follow this naming convention 
'<application name>.context' so that they will not conflict with one another.  Application contexts
can be shared across multiple scopes.


Scopes
--------------------------
Every application needs at least one scope that links the handler to the context and the server. The
scopes can be used to build a tree where clients can connect to every node and share objects inside this
scope (like shared objects or live streams).  You can see the scopes as rooms or instances.

The default scope usually has the name 'web.scope' and they should follow this naming convention 
'<application name>.scope' so that they will not conflict with one another.

The bean has the following properties:

  'server'
    This references the global server `red5.server`.
  'parent'
    References the parent for this scope and usually is `global.scope`.
  'context'
    The server context for this scope, use the `web.context` from above.
  'handler'
    The handler for this scope (see below).
  'contextPath'
    The path to use when connecting to this scope.
  'virtualHosts'
    A comma separated list of hostnames or ip addresses this scope runs at. In this version we do not control
	the host names, this is accomplished by the server.


A sample definition looks like this::

    <bean id="ofla.scope" class="org.red5.server.WebScope" init-method="register">
        <property name="server" ref="red5.server" />
        <property name="parent" ref="global.scope" />
        <property name="context" ref="ofla.context" />
        <property name="handler" ref="ofla.handler" />
        <property name="contextPath" value="/oflaDemo" />
        <property name="virtualHosts" value="localhost, 127.0.0.1" />
    </bean>

The 'contextPath' specified in the configuration can be seen as "root" path of the scope.  You can add additional
elements after the configured path when connecting to dynamically create extra scopes.

These extra scopes all use the same handler but have their own properties, shared objects and live streams.


Handlers
--------------------------
Every context needs a handler that implements the methods called when a client connects to the scope, leaves it
and that contains additional methods that can be called by the client. The interface these handlers need to
implement is specified by 'org.red5.server.api.IScopeHandler', however you can implement other interfaces if you
want to control access to shared objects or streams.

A sample implementation that can be used as base class can be found at 'org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter'.
Please refer to the javadoc documentation for further details.

The bean for a scope handler is configured by::

    <bean id="ofla.handler" class="the.path.to.my.Application" singleton="true" />

The `id` attribute is referenced by the scope definition above.

If you don't need any special server-side logic, you can use the default
application handler provided by Red5::

    <bean id="web.handler" class="org.red5.server.adapter.ApplicationAdapter" singleton="true" />
