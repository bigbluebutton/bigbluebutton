These instructions help for determine which localization strings are used in the bigbluebutton-client

1) Get the keys from the properties file, execute:

awk 'match($0,"="){ print substr($0,1,RSTART-1) }' /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/locale/en_US/bbbResources.properties &> keys.properties

2) Copy the following text to a file called routine.sh:

for i in $(cat keys.properties)
do
  if grep -nr --exclude-dir="locale" $i /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/
  then
    echo "$i" >> keys-used.properties
  else
    echo "$i" >> keys-not-used.properties
  fi
done

Then run: sh routine.sh
