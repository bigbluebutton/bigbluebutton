Overview
--------

This document describes the RTMPT tunneling protocol as implemented by the
Red5 Open Source Flash Server. Please note that this document is _not_ an
official specification by Macromedia but hopefully helps other people to
write software that makes use of RTMPT.

RTMPT basically is a HTTP wrapper around the RTMP protocol that is sent using
POST requests from the client to the server. Because of the non-persistent
nature of HTTP connections, RTMPT requires the clients to poll for updates
periodically in order to get notified about events that are generated by the
server or other clients.

During the lifetime of a RTMPT session, four possible request types can be
sent to the server which will be described below.

URLs
----

The URL to be opened has the following form::
    
    http://server/<comand>/[<client>/]<index>

`<command>`
  denotes the RTMPT request type (see below)
`<client>`
  specifies the id of the client that performs the requests (only sent for
  established sessions)
`<index>`
  is a consecutive number that seems to be used to detect missing packages

Request / Response
------------------

All HTTP requests share some common properties:

  - They use HTTP 1.1 POST.
  - The content type is `application/x-fcs`.
  - The connection should be kept alive by the client and server to reduce
    network overhead.


The HTTP responses also share some properties:

  - The content type is `application/x-fcs`.
  - For all established sessions the first byte of the response data controls
    the polling interval of the client where higher values mean less polling
    requests.


Polling interval
----------------

The server always starts with a value of 0x01 after data was returned and
increases it after 10 emtpy replies. The maximum delay is 0x21 which causes
a delay of approximately 0.5 seconds between two requests.

Red5 currently increases the delay in the following steps:
0x01, 0x03, 0x05, 0x09, 0x11, 0x21.


Initial connect (command "open")
--------------------------------

This is the first request that is sent to the server in order to register a
client on the server and start a new session. The server replies with a unique
id (usually a number) that is used by the client for all future requests.

Note: the reply doesn't contain a value for the polling interval!
A successful connect resets the consecutive index that is used in the URLs.


Client updates (command "send")
-------------------------------

The data a client would send to the server using RTMP is simply prefixed with
a HTTP header and otherwise sent unmodified.

The server responds with a HTTP response containing one byte controlling the
polling interval and the RTMP data if available.


Polling requests (command "idle")
---------------------------------

If the client doesn't have more data to send to the server, he has to poll
for updates to receive streaming data or events like shared objects.


Disconnect of a session (command "close")
-----------------------------------------

If a client wants to terminate his connection, he sends the "close" command
which is replied with a 0x00 by the server.
