 How to setup Red5 clustering
=============================

This document describes the steps to configure and deploy your application on Red5 
clustering. 

As of now, the current trunk only supports the clustering configuration for multiple
Edges with one Origin. The Edge server only accepts RTMP connection.

Server Configuration
====================
There are several configuration files added to support Edge/Origin configuration, 
they are under conf/:

 - red5-edge.xml, red5-edge-core.xml -- used for Edge Spring bean configuration. 
 - red5-origin.xml, red5-origin-core.xml -- used for Origin Spring bean configuration

Configure Edge Server
=====================
You don't need to deploy your application on Edges. We strongly recommend you to deploy
Edge on a different server from Origin. But it should be OK to deploy the Edge on the
same server as Origin.

Edge on a different Server from Origin
======================================
Update the configuration of bean "mrtmpClient" in red5-edge-core.xml to point to the 
Origin server:

    <bean id="mrtmpClient" class="org.red5.server.net.mrtmp.MRTMPClient"
	  init-method="start">
    	<property name="ioHandler" ref="mrtmpHandler" />
    	<property name="server" value="origin.example.com" />
    	<property name="port" value="${mrtmp.port}" />
    </bean>
    
Now you can start the server with red5.sh or 'java -jar red5.jar'.

Edge on the same Server as Origin
=================================
You don't need to change red5.xml. Copy $(RED5_EDGE_ROOT)/conf/red5.xml to 
$(RED5_ORIGIN_ROOT)/red5-edge.xml and start the server with 
'java -jar red5.jar red5-edge.xml' or update red5.sh and add the 'red5-edge.xml'
parameter.

Configure Origin Server
=======================
Deploy your application to webapps/. Make sure your 9035 port is not blocked by a
firewall. The port will be used by Edge servers to create a connection with the Origin
server. Start the server with red5.sh or 'java -jar red5.jar'.

Your RTMP can go through Edges now. Your RTMPT and HTTP can go through Origin as normal.
