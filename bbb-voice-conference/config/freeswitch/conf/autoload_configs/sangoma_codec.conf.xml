		<!-- 
		List of codecs to not register with FreeSWITCH, by default this is empty,
	        but you may want to not load PCMU and PCMA or may be others to not use your 
	        resources in codecs that are done well and fast in software.

		<!--
		Transcoding SOAP server URL. If you are installing the soap server (sngtc_server)
		in the same box where FreeSWITCH, do not use this value, the default URL
		that is hard-coded will work out of the box for local installations.
		If you modify this value, you must configure your SOAP server (/etc/sngtc/sngtc_server.conf.xml)
		to listen for HTTP requests on the same IP/port that you specify here.
		<param name="soapserver" value="http://192.168.1.100:8080"/>

		<!--
		RTP IP to use
		By default, this module asks FreeSWITCH for the local ip address. However if you want to use a specific
		IP address you can set it here.
		<param name="rtpip" value="192.168.1.1"/>
