    This is the FreeSWITCH default config.  Everything you see before you now traverses
    down into all the directories including files which include more files.  The default
    config comes out of the box already working in most situations as a PBX.  This will
    allow you to get started testing and playing with various things in FreeSWITCH.

    Before you start to modify this default please visit this wiki page:

    http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Getting_Started_Guide#Some_stuff_to_try_out.21

    If all else fails you can read our FAQ located at:

  <!--#comment
      All comments starting with #command will be preprocessed and never sent to the xml parser
      Valid instructions:
      #include ==> Include another file to this exact point
                   (partial xml should be encased in <include></include> tags)
      #set     ==> Set a global variable (can be expanded during preprocessing with $$ variables)
                   (note the double $$ which denotes preprocessor variables)
      #comment ==> A general comment such as this

      The preprocessor will compile the full xml document to ${prefix}/log/freeswitch.xml.fsxml
      Don't modify it while freeswitch is running cos it is mem mapped in most cases =D

      The same can be achieved with the <X-PRE-PROCESS> tag where the attrs 'cmd' and 'data' are
      parsed in the same way.

      vars.xml contains all the #set directives for the preprocessor.
