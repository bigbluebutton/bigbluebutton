 * The PointCloudSystem (PCS) is a single updatable mesh. The points corresponding to the vertices of this big mesh.
 * As it is just a mesh, the PointCloudSystem has all the same properties as any other BJS mesh : not more, not less. It can be scaled, rotated, translated, enlighted, textured, moved, etc.

 * The PointCloudSytem is also a particle system, with each point being a particle. It provides some methods to manage the particles.
 * However it is behavior agnostic. This means it has no emitter, no particle physics, no particle recycler. You have to implement your own behavior.
