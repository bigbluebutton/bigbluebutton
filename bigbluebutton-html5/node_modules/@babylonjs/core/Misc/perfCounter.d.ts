/**
 * This class is used to track a performance counter which is number based.
 * The user has access to many properties which give statistics of different nature.
 *
 * The implementer can track two kinds of Performance Counter: time and count.
 * For time you can optionally call fetchNewFrame() to notify the start of a new frame to monitor, then call beginMonitoring() to start and endMonitoring() to record the lapsed time. endMonitoring takes a newFrame parameter for you to specify if the monitored time should be set for a new frame or accumulated to the current frame being monitored.
 * For count you first have to call fetchNewFrame() to notify the start of a new frame to monitor, then call addCount() how many time required to increment the count value you monitor.
