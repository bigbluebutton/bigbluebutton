  # If the message contains characters not in ISO-8859-1 character sets
  # they must be properly escaped to unicode characters. An easy way to
  # do this is running the native2ascii command setting UTF8 encoding and

  #
  # native2ascii -encoding UTF8 bigbluebutton.properties bigbluebutton.properties
