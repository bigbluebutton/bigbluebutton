This document is meant to be a combination of manual and (labeled so) automated tests, listed per feature of BigBlueButton.

The <b>automated tests</b> are only a portion of the testing done before a release. Ideally they should be triggered often, for example when testing pull requests, or once a day automatically.

The <b>manual tests</b> really help to ensure release quality. They should
be performed by humans using different browsers. It is useful to have multiple
humans performing these tests together. You should plan at least an hour to perform
all of these tests.
